	<h1>Under the Gun: Preparing for an active shooter situation at UCLA</h1>
	<h3>Intro by Chris Campbell, Radio Director</h3>

	<p>Santa Monica College, 2013. UC Santa Barbara, 2014. Umpqua Community College, 2015.</p>

	<p>Mass shootings are on the rise at college campuses across the United States. From dorms to classrooms, UCLA is laying out plans to keep students safe in an active shooter situation. Over 43,000 students attend this school, so any effective plan will require massive coordination and effort from police and administration.</p>

	<p>The UCLA Office of Emergency Management has procedures set in place to address the possibility of an on-campus gunman. The Office of Residential Life trains resident assistants to handle active shooters in the dorms. The university police has been running drills this quarter. And firearms are prohibited on or near any UCLA property.</p>

	<p>Yet debate over policies and procedures still surrounds the issue. Daily Bruin Radio's intern class explores the policies and legal issues surrounding university gun control and safety measures.</p>
